# Assignment: Hello, World!

<mark>Due 09/17 at 11:59</mark>

A classic first program to test that your toolchain (runtime environment, compiler, <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDE</abbr>, etc.) is set up properly is the "Hello, World!" program.

> ...the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book The C Programming Language...

See [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to read more about it.

### Step One: Set up OneCompiler Studio

### Step Two: Print "Hello, World!"

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Step Three: Experiment

You can do a lot by just printing to the terminal! Here are some ideas to get started:

- Use multiple `print()` statements
- Try printing with the special characters `\t` and `\n`
- See if you can make some simple [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)
