# Password Generator

<mark>Due 10/02 at 11:59</mark>

A good safety practice is to _randomly generate your passwords_; this makes it very difficult for a hacker to guess your password. In this assignment, you will implement your own password generator.

Your program must meet the following specifications:

- Create a **list** variable with possible characters to pick from
- Ask the user for the password length
- Use a loop to randomly select characters (`a`-`f` & `0`-`9`)
- Print the generated password to the terminal

> A common technique in brute-force hacking is to create special "dictionary" of words and phrases that are specific to the person they are hacking. Lots of people choose a password they can remember that includes their birthday, their pet's name, the school they attend, etc. However, that is **very insecure** because that information is fairly easy to obtain through social media, conversations with friends, or public records.
