Previously you made a [quiz game](/2024/fall/computer-science/assignments/quiz). In this project, you will _refactor_ the project and expand it with new features.

> **[Refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)** is the process of rewriting code without changing its behavior. This often happens to improve readability, maintainability, or performance.

Your revised quiz must still meet these original specifications:

- Includes <abbr title="10 in binary">1010</abbr> ðŸ˜‰ or more questions
- Tells the user if they were right or wrong after each question
- Gives the user a score at the end

Additionally, you **must** refactor the code to use the following techniques:

- Store your quiz questions in a list
- Use a loop to ask all of the questions

<p class="notice">
  Remember, new assigments should <strong>not</strong> have their own Replit projects. There should be a new file for this project that is imported in <code>main.py</code> (and make sure to comment out previous projects). Review the <a href="/2024/fall/computer-science/assignments/setup-replit">Set Up Replit</a> project page for steps.
